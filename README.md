# Sofia's Bistro

**One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.*

**Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.*

Sofia's Bistro is a fictional small scale family owned business that serves selected food of Italian cuisine passed down in the family through generations. The bistro was created with the intention to bring awareness into the community about the restaurant. By featuring the menu served by the bistro, and providing a section for individuals who visited the restaurant, the project served its purpose to use a website as a medium to in rendering views to the community about the bistro as well as a means for the bistro owner to receive feedback in an open way. Ultimately, the website aimed to serve the as a medium to the business owners to hear from their visitors/customers to receive input for future implementaion plans to expand their business.



## UX
 
**Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

**In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

**This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

The website is meant for potential customers and existing customers to be able to know of the restaurant and what food they serve.

As a website visitor, I will access the website url, which will take me to the homepage. I will be able to comprehend business nature of the website owner from the website name and the visual presentation.

As a website visitor, I will click the 'About' navigation tab so as to get an understanding of the business nature of the website owner, and also access the website owner's contact details.

As a website visitor, click the 'Menu' navigation tab which will show me the type of food the bistro sells. This will serve the purpose of me to make the decision if the menu is what I would like to consider if I am choosing an eating establishment to visit.

As a website visitor, I will click the 'Review' navigation dropdown tab, and then click on the 'All Reviews' to have an understanding of how customers have found the bistro to be. This will give me further insight to making a decision on whether to consider visitng the bistro.

As a website visitor who has visited the restaurant, click the 'Review' navigation dropdown tab, and then click on the 'Add Review' so to be able to complete the review form to provide my dining experience.

As a website visitor who has submitted a review and wishes to make amendments to it, click on the 'Review' navigation dropdown tab, and click on the 'Edit' button for the respective review to be amended. This will display the stored contents of the review in the format of the form. After making the necessary amendments, click on the 'Edit' button. The website site will then redirect to the 'All Reviews' page and display a notification that the review was successfully updated, which will be visible on that page.

## Features

**In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The website navigation bar has four sections:

1. Home - This is the first page displayed to the site visitor, it gives a visual image of the bistro.

2. About - This is where the site visitor is able to retrieve information about the bistro's contact details and location.

3. Menu - This features the menu which the bistro serves.

4. Reviews - This tab leads to two sections: 
   (i) All Reviews - This is where the site visitor is able to view all reviews posted by customers. Each posted review provides the user the option to amend or delete the posted review.
   (ii) Add Review - This opens to a form whereby the site visitor is able to provide their review and rate their visit to the bistro.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
